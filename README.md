# Responsive Login & Register Form

This project is a basic responsive login and registration form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to practice front-end web development and improve my skills in creating responsive designs.

## Features

- **Responsive Design** – The form adapts to different screen sizes for better usability.
- **Login Form – Includes** input fields for username and password.
- **Registration Form** – Contains fields for full name, username, and password.
- **Social Login Options** – Supports Google and Apple sign-in for easier access.
- **Simple and Clean U**I – Designed with a minimalistic approach for better user experience.

## Files in This Project

- `login.html` : Contains the structure of the login page.
- `register.html` : Contains the structure of the registration page.
- `style.css` : Handles the styling and responsiveness of the forms.
- `script.js` : Adds interactivity, such as form validation and warning messages.

This project is still a work in progress, and I plan to make further improvements over time. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
